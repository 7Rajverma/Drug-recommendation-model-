The repository Drug Recommendation Model implements a machine learning model designed to recommend drugs based on patient information. The model uses a dataset with features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and patient conditions to predict the most suitable drug category. This approach demonstrates how data-driven methods can assist in healthcare decision-making.

Dataset:

Contains patient-specific features like age, gender, cholesterol levels (normal/high), and blood pressure levels (low/normal/high).
The target variable is the drug category, representing the type of drug recommended for each patient.
Model Implementation:

A classification algorithm (likely Decision Tree Classifier, as commonly used for such problems) is used to predict the drug category.
The model learns patterns in the data, associating patient features with specific drug categories.
Workflow:

Data Preprocessing: Encodes categorical features and prepares the data for training and testing.
Training and Testing: Splits the data to evaluate model accuracy and avoid overfitting.
Visualization: Uses tools like decision tree plots to explain the logic behind predictions.
Model Performance:

Assessed using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix to measure how well the model predicts drug recommendations.
Real-World Applicability:

Demonstrates a simplified version of how healthcare professionals might use AI/ML models to assist in prescribing medications.
Can be further developed to include more nuanced medical data and drug interactions.
This project showcases the power of machine learning in healthcare, providing a foundation for developing more advanced systems for personalized medicine.
